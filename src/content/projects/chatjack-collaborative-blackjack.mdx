# Introducing ChatJack: Community-Powered Blackjack on Twitch

Experience the classic game of blackjack like never before with **ChatJack**, a Twitch-integrated game that allows your community to play together using simple chat commands.

## Key Features

- **Community Voting**: Players vote on actions like `!hit` or `!stand`, making each decision a collaborative effort.
- **No Monetary Stakes**: Enjoy the thrill of blackjack without any betting or monetary involvementâ€”just pure fun.
- **Twitch Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the Twitch API, enabling real-time chat commands to control the game.
- **Spectator and Moderator Modes**: Broadcasters and moderators can manage the game and display it on stream using OBS tools like Pogly.
- **AI Dealer**: After the community's turn, the AI dealer reveals its hole card and completes its turn, adding suspense to the game.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust vote durations, frames per second, number of decks, and more to tailor the experience to your community.

## How It Works

1. **Starting the Game**: A moderator initiates the game by clicking "Play" and selecting a channel, and the community is prompted to join.
2. **Community Decisions**: Viewers vote using chat commands (`!hit` or `!stand`) within a set timeframe.
3. **AI Dealer's Turn**: Once the community stands, the AI dealer reveals its cards and plays its hand.
4. **Round Outcome**: The result is displayed, and the community can start a new round by typing `!restart`.
