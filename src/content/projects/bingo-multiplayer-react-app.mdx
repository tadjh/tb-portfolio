- Leveraged Socket.io to create an event-driven multiplayer room-based bingo game. Also available in singleplayer.
- Server and client are coded in React/Typescript, architected in a yarn monorepo and deployed to Heroku.
- The themeable React components were designed with TailwindCSS and tested in Storybook.
- Multiplayer end-to-end tests were implemented in Cypress and thoroughly tested with Jest unit &#38; intergration tests.
- Sound effects and music recorded and edited in Ableton Live.
