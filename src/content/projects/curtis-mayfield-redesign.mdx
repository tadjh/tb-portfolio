- Redesigned entire website portfolio from the ground up with NextJS.
- Utilized React Server Components to query the content api and cache the resulting pages, with client-side re-hydration for interactive pages.
- Leveraged GROQ, a GraphQL-like query language, to request page content from a heavily modified content management system.
- Extended Sanity CMS to manage & create many documents, objects and media types within the customized CMS.
- Designed and created a JSON-based page loading animation using LottieJS inside of Adobe After Effects.
