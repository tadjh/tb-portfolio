# Curtis Mayfield Redesign

A modern redesign for a legendary GRAMMY Award Winning R&B and Soul musician Curtis Mayfield.

<Hype
  items={[
    { icon: faClock, value: 270, label: "hours" },
    { icon: faBarsStaggered, value: 11295, label: "lines" },
    { icon: faCodeCommit, value: 293, label: "commits" },
  ]}
  client:visible
/>

## Highlights

- Redesigned entire website portfolio from the ground up with <mark>Next.js</mark>.
- Utilized <mark>React Server Components</mark> to query the content api and cache the resulting pages, with client-side re-hydration for interactive pages.
- Leveraged <mark>GROQ</mark>, a GraphQL-like query language, to request page content from a heavily modified content management system.
- Extended <mark>Sanity CMS</mark> to manage & create many documents, objects and media types within the customized CMS.
- Designed and created a JSON-based page loading animation using <mark>LottieJS</mark> & <mark>Adobe After Effects</mark>.

## Goals

One the of main goals with the redesign was bringing Curtis Mayfield mechandise to the forefront, instead of it being an afterthought. I designed an eye-popping carousel with <mark>Framer Motion</mark>. Each item in the carousel links externally to Curtis Mayfield's mechandise distributer Rhino.

  <Video autoPlay muted loop class="animate-fadeInView" media={merchCarousel} />
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <figcaption>A responsive carousel built with accessibility in mind.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Constraints

A major constraint of the re-design was keeping all of the current website content intact while presenting said content in new and interactive ways. The Albums page is stellar example of how a good design, not only can make pages load blazingly fast, but also make an entire website a joy to browse.

<figure>
  <BeforeAfter client:visible>
    <Image
      src={musicArchiveBefore}
      alt="CurtisMayfield.com music archive page before"
      slot="before"
    />
    <Image
      src={musicArchive}
      alt="CurtisMayfield.com music archive page after"
      slot="after"
    />
  </BeforeAfter>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <figcaption>The music archive page now features gorgeous images and better utilizes the screen real-estate across all devices.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <BeforeAfter client:visible>
    <Image
      src={musicSingleBefore}
      alt="CurtisMayfield.com music interior page before"
      slot="before"
    />
    <Image
      src={musicSingle}
      alt="CurtisMayfield.com music interior page after"
      slot="after"
    />
  </BeforeAfter>
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <figcaption>The album interior page went from dozens of iframes per page, to a single Spoitfy lazy-loaded embed, taking the page speed from dozens of seconds to a few milliseconds to load.</figcaption>
</figure>

## The Dream

A long-time dream of the Curtis Mayfield Estate was having an interactive timeline of Curtis' life. Implementing this feature was one the stretch-goals for this project, but I found the time to create something we were all extremely proud of.

<figure>
  <Video autoPlay muted loop class="animate-fadeInView" media={timelineVideo} />
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  <figcaption>A rich click-thru timeline of Curtis' life and legendary career.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Lessons

This project really tested my abilities, from developing on the bleeding edge of <mark>Next.js</mark> during the launch of <mark>React Server Components</mark>, to content management schema design and optimization. Be it image optimization, animaton optimization, database query optimization or server caching optimization, this was a truly full-stack development project.
