# About

A full-stack software engineer with a voracious appetite for learning where I hope to apply my skills in developing, problem solving and user experience on real products that make a difference in people's lives.

How many Grammy nominated audio engineers spend 20 hours of their weekend learning Typescript? One too many, it would appear. I started coding back in 2015. My dad ran a web development business and I started helping him on the weekends. I was immediately enthralled. I chose to dedicate my days to music and my nights to development. In the nine years since I started, I‚Äôve built & maintained websites for over 70 businesses across eCommerce, professional portfolios, and charitable organizations. I‚Äôve spent over 1,000 hours refining my skills in React, Typescript, Javascript, Tailwind CSS, and more.

Like many other men in their 30s, I love gaming. Twitch came to prominence in 2012 and I was lucky enough to have a front row seat to all the action. Over time, I started to engage with my favorite streamers. I saw an opportunity to apply my passion for development to a game I loved (GTA, of course).

So I got to work:

üïπÔ∏è I built a [multi-player bingo game](/projects/bingo-multiplayer-react-app/#main) as part of a storyline.

üöó I've designed custom automobile wraps. As well
as configured my own modded Grand Theft Auto Development Server in order to test them.

üî¶ I've most recently taught myself 3D modeling to create an epic torch, a customizable scroll, and other new props for players to use in the game.


I often get lost in my work, spending hours upon hours building for the fun of it. The deeper I got into development, the clearer it became, I‚Äôm ready to do it as my full time job. I will always love music, but I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my life.
