# About

A full-stack software engineer with a voracious appetite for learning where I hope to apply my skills in developing, problem solving and user experience on real products that make a difference in people's lives.

How many Grammy nominated audio engineers spend 20 hours of their weekend learning Typescript? One too many, it would appear. I started coding back in 2015. My dad ran a Web Development business and I started helping him on the weekends. I was immediately enthralled. I chose to dedicate my days to music and my nights to development. In the nine years since I started, I‚Äôve built & maintained websites for over 70 businesses across eCommerce, professional portfolios, and charitable organizations. I‚Äôve spent over 1,000 hours refining my skills in <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Typescript</mark>, <mark>Javascript</mark>, <mark>CSS</mark>, and more.

Like many other men in their 30s, I love gaming. Twitch came to prominence in 2012 and I was lucky enough to have a front row seat to all the action. Over time, I started to engage with my favorite streamers. I saw an opportunity to apply my passion for development to a game I loved (Grand Theft Auto IV).

So I got to work:

üïπÔ∏è I built a [multi-player bingo game](/projects/bingo-multiplayer-react-app/#main) as part of an in-game storyline.

üöó I've designed custom automobile wraps. As well used <mark>Lua</mark> as configured my own modded <mark>FiveM</mark> Grand Theft Auto development server in order to test them.

üî¶ I've most recently taught myself 3D modeling to create a [Survivor](https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/)-inpsired epic torch and other new props for players to use in the game.

I often get lost in my work, spending hours upon hours building for the fun of it. The deeper I got into development, the clearer it became, I‚Äôm ready to do it as my full-time job. I will always love music, but I'm looking forward to this next chapter in my life.
