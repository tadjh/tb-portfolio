        First and foremost, <strong>civilians</strong> would be my focus for
        this term, and have been my focus for the past few months. I want to run
        not only more of my own events that are civilian friendly and open to
        everyone, but also support those who have ideas of their own and help
        however I can to make their ideas a reality through the revival of the
        <strong>Parks & Recreation</strong> department. I would like to
        implement several government departments specifically designed for
        interesting <strong>new jobs</strong> for civilians, including creative
        positions in the <strong>Department of Public Health</strong>,
        introducing <strong>The Postal Service</strong>, and much more.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Within the Mayor’s office itself, I aim to make some changes that will
        encourage <strong>interaction</strong> and <strong
          >relationship-building</strong
        > between myself, my team, and the entities and individuals that seek
        out our assistance. I want to meet with the people that need me, and be
        actively in the loop as to what we can do to help, not simply rely on
        digital interaction via automated forms. In addition, I will be holding
        a weekly town hall to hear from the citizens, as well as, at a different
        time, hold an open floor for businesses or events that are seeking
        funding to present their ideas in front of a panel who are ready and
        willing to help those that they feel could bring something <strong
          >unique and wonderful</strong
        > to the city.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        When it comes to governmental entities, I have always loved checking in
        on the <strong>Police Departments</strong>, the <strong
          >Department of Corrections</strong
        >, the <strong>Department of Justice</strong>, and healthcare positions
        to make sure I’m up to date on anything and everything I can do to lend
        a hand, and I will continue that trend through this term as I did in my
        first two.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Above all else, I know I can promise <strong>
          efficiency, organization, and hard work
        </strong> in my term. I hold myself to a higher standard than what’s
        probably realistic, but I love to help people, and I will always do
        everything in my power to perform quick, efficient, and detailed work in
        my efforts to make this city <strong>a better place to live</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This platform will be subject to additions as the campaign moves forward
        and as I speak to more groups and entities around the city to hear what
        everyone is looking for more specifically from their next Mayor to help
        improve their time in our lovely state. I encourage everyone to reach
        out to me personally to see what else I’ve been able to identify that
        I’d like to work on or add to the city.
